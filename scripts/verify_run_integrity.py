"""Refuse to trust metrics from a run in which any stage silently failed.

WHY THIS EXISTS
---------------
Neither the BroadTrack calibration stage nor the jersey stage aborts the run when
its subprocess fails: both log an ERROR and return, and the pipeline continues to
completion. A run can therefore finish, write an evaluation table, and report
numbers that were computed with NO camera calibration (so no pitch coordinates)
or NO jersey numbers. Those numbers look plausible and are wrong.

This gate inspects a finished run and exits non-zero if anything silently failed.
It is read-only: it never modifies the pipeline or its outputs.

    python scripts/verify_run_integrity.py                      # newest eval log
    python scripts/verify_run_integrity.py --log eval_results/eval_test.log
    python scripts/verify_run_integrity.py --expect-sequences 49

Exit code 0 = every stage produced its artifacts and logged no failure.
Anything else = DO NOT REPORT THESE METRICS.
